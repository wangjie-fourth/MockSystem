/**
 * Indicates a class to be tested, with optional automatic instantiation and/or automatic injection of dependencies.
 * This annotation is applicable to instance fields of a test class, and to test method parameters; alternatively, it
 * can be used as a meta-annotation on a user-defined annotation which, in turn, needs to have
 * {@linkplain RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME runtime} {@linkplain Retention retention} and be {@linkplain Target applicable}
 * to {@linkplain ElementType#FIELD fields} and/or {@linkplain ElementType#PARAMETER parameters}.
 * <p/>
 * Every non-{@code final} tested field and every tested parameter is eligible for automatic instantiation and
 * initialization.
 * By default, automatic instantiation occurs just before a test method is executed.
 * This default can be changed by specifying the {@link #availableDuringSetup} optional attribute as {@code true} in a
 * tested field declaration (it is ignored if applied to a tested parameter).
 * Whenever automatic creation occurs, a suitable instance of the tested class is created, initialized, and assigned to
 * the tested field or passed as argument to the tested parameter when the test method gets executed.
 * Available {@linkplain Injectable injectables} are used, either as argument values for the chosen constructor of the
 * tested class, or as values to set into injected fields of the newly-created tested object.
 * <p/>
 * For <em>constructor injection</em>, all constructor parameters (if any) must be satisfied with the values of
 * available injectables.
 * If the tested class has a constructor annotated with the standard CDI annotation "<code>@Inject</code>", then it is
 * the one to be used;
 * otherwise, if there are multiple satisfiable constructors then the one with the most parameters <em>and</em> the
 * widest accessibility (ie, first {@code public}, then {@code protected}, then <em>package-private</em>, and finally
 * {@code private}) is chosen.
 * The matching between injectable values and constructor parameters is done by <em>type</em> when there is only one
 * parameter of a given type; otherwise, by type <em>and name</em>.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Field injection</em> is performed on all tested objects, even when it was not instantiated automatically.
 * Only non-<code>final</code> fields are considered, between those declared in the tested class itself or in one of its
 * super-classes; at this time constructor injection already occurred, so only fields which remain uninitialized are
 * targeted.
 * For each such <em>target</em> field, the value of a still unused injectable of a matching type is assigned, if any is
 * available.
 * When a tested object has multiple target fields of a matching type, not just the type but also the <em>name</em> of
 * each field will be used when looking for available injectables.
 * Finally, if there is no matching and available injectable value for a given target field, it is left unassigned,
 * unless the target field is for a <em>required</em> dependency; note that all fields marked with a DI annotation
 * (such as {@code @Inject}, {@code Autowired}, etc.) indicate required dependencies by default
 * (the use of "<code>@Autowired(required = false)</code>" is respected, if present).
 * <p/>
 * Tested fields/parameters whose declared type is primitive, a primitive wrapper, numeric, or an enum can use the
 * {@link #value} attribute to specify an initial value from a string.
 * <p/>
 * Custom names specified in field annotations from Java EE ({@code @Resource(name)}, {@code @Named}) or the Spring
 * framework ({@code @Qualifier}) are used when looking for a matching {@code @Injectable} or {@code @Tested} value.
 * When such a name contains a {@code -} (dash) or {@code .} (dot) character, the corresponding camel-cased name is used
 * instead.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever constructor or field injection is used, the value of each injectable goes into <em>at most one</em> matching
 * constructor parameter or instance field of a tested class.
 * <p/>
 * The tested class can be {@code abstract}.
 * In this case, if the tested field is left null then a subclass implementing all abstract methods is automatically
 * generated and instantiated.
 * The abstract method implementations are automatically <em>mocked</em> so that expectations can be recorded or
 * verified on them.
 * <p/>
 * When the {@link #fullyInitialized} attribute is {@code true}, all eligible fields in the tested object will get
 * initialized with a suitable instance, which itself is recursively initialized in the same way.
 *

     * <p/>
     * Non-eligible fields are those that have already being assigned from a constructor, or that have a primitive,
     * array, annotation, or JRE type (with the exception of the types described below, which are given special
     * treatment).

     * For each field of a reference type that would otherwise remain {@code null}, an attempt is made to automatically

     * For this attempt to succeed, the type of the field must either be a concrete class having a constructor that can
     * be satisfied by available injectables and/or by recursively created dependencies, or a known interface (see below)
     * for which a real instance can be created.

     *       {@linkplain java.util.logging.Logger#getLogger(String) created} with the name of the tested class.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *       {@link javax.sql.DataSource}: a JDBC data source is created and configured according to a matching
     *       {@link javax.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition @DataSourceDefinition} in the tested class.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *       {@link javax.inject.Provider Provider&lt;T>}: a provider which produces an instance of type {@code T} is
     *       injected.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *       JPA interfaces {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory} and {@link javax.persistence.EntityManager}:
     *       created through calls to {@link javax.persistence.Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(String)} and
     *       {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}, provided a suitable
     *       {@code META-INF/persistence.xml} file is available in the runtime classpath.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *       Servlet interfaces {@link javax.servlet.ServletContext} and {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession}:
     *       objects that emulate the servlet context and HTTP session are automatically created for use in tests.
     *    </li>
     *    <li>
     *       {@link javax.enterprise.context.Conversation}: an object that emulates a web application's conversation
